# beans
Beans is a powerful lighting control solution, built on open source software. The ecosystem allows for customisation at every level, and includes a powerful build system for C interoperability. It is mostly written in [Dart](dart.dev), and makes use of the Hot Reload engine to execute user-defined scripts and workflows at runtime.

## IO
Beans will be able to output sACN (via [libe131](https://github.com/hhromic/libe131)), ArtNet (via [libartnet](https://github.com/tobiasebsen/libartnet)), and DMX-512 over hardware ports.

## Supported hardware
Custom hardware is coming to Beans - watch this space!!
